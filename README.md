### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Aruthran. I am a 14 year old web developer with experience in html, css and Javascript. I have also taken a couple of CS courses online, to get an understanding of Algorithms and Datsa structures. I like to share tips on learning web development on twitter. This is my twitter profile https://twitter.com/The_Tech_Nerd9.
